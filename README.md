# Conway's Game of Life

A browser-based simulation of Conway's famous cellular automaton. This project allows users to build a customizable grid, set the initial state by toggling cells, and then run or step through the simulation to observe how patterns evolve over time. It supports adjustments to grid dimensions and simulation speed, providing interactive controls to start, pause, and step through the simulation.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**  
   Use Git to clone the repository or download the source code as a ZIP file:
   • Git clone:  
     git clone https://github.com/ShaneMarusczak/Game-of-Life.git

2. **Directory Structure**  
   The project does not require any external build tools. It is entirely composed of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite browser to get started.

3. **Dependencies**  
   - The project uses [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for "Roboto Mono" and "Roboto".  
   - No additional libraries or frameworks are needed.

## Usage Guide

1. **Open the Application**  
   Launch your browser and open the `index.html` file located in the root of the project or use a local server.

2. **Configure the Simulation**  
   - **Rows and Columns:** Change the number of rows and columns by editing the inputs (default 30x30). Valid numbers range from 1 to 75.
   - **Lifespan (Speed):** Set the simulation delay in milliseconds (valid range: 1-500 ms, default 200 ms).

3. **Build and Start the Grid**  
   - Click the **Build Grid** button to generate the cell grid.
   - Once the grid is built, click **Start** to begin the simulation.

4. **During Simulation**  
   - Use the **Faster** and **Slower** buttons to adjust simulation speed on the fly.
   - **Pause** the simulation or perform a **Single Step** for a detailed view of each generation.
   - Toggle the **Show Enabled Cells** checkbox to highlight cells that are enabled for state changes.

5. **Cell Interaction**  
   Before starting the simulation, click individual cells on the grid to toggle their "alive" state. This initial setup determines the starting configuration for the Game of Life.

## File and Structure Overview

• **index.html**  
  The main HTML file that sets up the page, links to styles and scripts, and provides the basic interface elements (header, menu, and game board UI).

• **css/**  
  - **style.css:** The unminified CSS file with styles for layout, grid, and interactive elements.
  - **style.min.css:** The minified version of the styling for production use.

• **js/**  
  - **gameOfLife.js:** The primary JavaScript file containing the game logic, simulation controls, grid builder, and event handlers.
  - **gameOfLife.min.js:** A minified version of the JavaScript for optimized delivery.

• **images, Favicons & Manifest**  
  These include icons (e.g., GitHub and home icons), favicons, and the `site.webmanifest` that support a modern look and ensure compatibility with various devices.

## Configuration Details

- **Simulation Parameters:**  
  Configurable parameters such as grid dimensions (rows, columns) and simulation speed are set via the input fields in `index.html`. The allowed ranges are safeguarded by regular expression checks in the JavaScript.

- **File Settings:**  
  The CSS files define the layout and responsive behaviors, while the JavaScript files implement the core logic:
  • Input validations ensure rows (1-75), columns (1-75), and speed (1-500 ms).
  • The simulation logic handles cell states, neighbor evaluation, and generation updates.
  • The project supports both normal and minified versions, as seen in `gameOfLife.js` and `gameOfLife.min.js`.
